**Task**

The goal of this project was to merge different (may be) relevant dataset to UFO sightings dataset. After merging we were required to performed analysis of UFO sightings and inferred unintended consequences using clustering and content similarity.
Extracted correlation features and compared similarities between datasets using Edit, Cosine and Jaccard distance.


**Libraries used**

Used the following libraries to process the data.
The following pip command installs library <LIB> into your environment.
	pip install <LIB>
where <LIB> is:
1.	Pandas
2.	Geopy
3.	Editdistance
4.	python-dateutil

**Final analysis**

Found which sighting records might be results of phenomena like meteorite shower, influence of Sci-Fi movie on thoughts,
flight flying mistaken as UFO or literacy rates of people
